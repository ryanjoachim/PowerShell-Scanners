## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the mechanism you can use to submit your PowerShell Scanners to this repository. GitHub itself has some [great documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) on using the Pull Request feature. We use the "fork and pull" model [described here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/), where contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests to bring those changes into the source repository.

Please follow the [Style Guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md) when crafting your pull request.

All pull requests are reviewed by a PDQ.com employee. We'll try to get to your pull request as soon as we can, but please be patient.

#### Folder Structure
Each scanner gets its own folder. Give your folder a descriptive name. These are the expected files:

* Scan Profile.xml
  * This is a Scan Profile exported from Inventory as an XML file. It points to your .ps1 file with the File field.
* "Script".ps1
  * Replace "Script" with the same name you used for your folder.
* README.md
  * Put in as much detail as you think is necessary. Look at the other scanners for ideas.

You can use `New-Scanner.ps1` in the `PowerShell Scanners` folder to create these files for you.

```PowerShell
Set-Location 'C:\PowerShell-Scanners\PowerShell Scanners'
.\New-Scanner.ps1 -Name 'Your desired name'
```
